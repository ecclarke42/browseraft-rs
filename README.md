# `browseraft`

Coordinate between browsing contexts (windows/tabs/iframes/workers) using the
[raft](https://raft.github.io/) protocol, using the
[BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API)
API.

## Running The Example

The [multiworker](./examples/multiworker) example is built using
[`yew`](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) and
[`trunk`](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk). Follow `trunk`'s instructions for
installation, then run it with `trunk serve`.
